Hi, I'm Sam.

We all know that when codebases become too complex for a single application, it makes sense to break them up into multiple, smaller pieces. There's a lot of precedent for how to do this with backend systems, but we shouldn't leave our frontend interfaces behind.

In this talk I want to discuss how Ember lets teams build and maintain many  independent frontends in a consistent and sane way. Ember's conventions and tools like Ember CLI let teams share code, standardize deployments and easily integrate their interfaces with the rest of their backend systems.
