                I learned more about color correction, white balance and
                exposure. I got some soft boxes that are all 5000K temperature
                lighting and want to get some blackout curtains next so I have
                total control over the lighting in my videos. I played around
                with recording at night and the difference is dramatic when you
                have total control of the light and the camera's white balance
                dialed in correctly. The goal here is to get the look and style
                of all my videos the same. Now that I know a bit more about
                this, looking at my recent videos is kinda stark! They all look
                very different from each other. But I suppose continuous
                improvement is the name of the game.

                I also learned about shooting in Log format and using a LUT
                (lookup table) to decompress the image. Shooting in Log prevents
                the camera from losing data on the brightest and darkest parts
                of an image. It does this by compressing the data, so that the
                raw image ends up looking very flat. You then use a LUT to
                decompress it into a standard (REC 709) format where you can
                then make your additional tweaks and grades. The goal here is to
                get my environment set up in such a way that I can record, apply
                a LUT, and have a similar-looking video every time.

                While working on my Twitter clone I was asking Adam a question
                about line height. He noticed I had added a font size of 15px
                and said it was going to affect many parts of the UI. I said I
                added it because mobile twitter.com uses 15px, and I wanted to
                match it. It was an interesting conversation and made me realize
                that if you do want to add something like a 15px font size to
                Tailwind's theme, you really should take the time to trace that
                through and think about the corresponding changes to line height
                and the spacing scale that it entails, because many of these
                values are interrelated. For example, with a 15px font size, you
                can't match icons without also adjusting the spacing scale. The
                default scale of a 16px base and a 4 unit scale is, in Adam's
                words, "the hardest to mess up."

                One question that came up a few times from my video was whether
                JavaScript equality (===) could be used to compare two pieces of
                React state. In all my tests, "setBuffer(data)" made the
                "buffer" state an actual reference to the same object that
                "data" referenced, meaning, both pieces of state referred to the
                same JavaScript object. And therefore the equality check could
                be used, even across renders. Definitely a useful thing to know!

                My Twitter clone video ended up a bit long. I'd like to get on a
                consistent weekly cadence of publishing videos in the 6-9 minute

                Potentially-Pure Functions. It seems that in a langugage like

                its arguments. The reason I'm spending so much time trying to

                Dependabot has been churning through our Netlify build resources
                for miragejs.com. We automerge in-range dependency updates, so
                the Netlify preview builds for Dependabot PRs were literally
                going unused. I learned that you can tell Netlify not to build a
                PR if the commit message has "[skip netlify]" in it, so I
                customized our Dependabot config to add this ‚Äì and it worked!
                Still need to smooth this out a bit as the builds are ignored
                when merged to master, but for now it is helping alleviate the
                problem. Check out the link for our current config.

                Hasura lets you configure permissions for unauthenticated users,
                which is perfect for making certain queries public (like the
                blog posts for your homepage) without needing to add support for
                user accounts. The docs are confusing and also incorrect in a
                few places, but all you need to do is set the
                `HASURA_GRAPHQL_UNAUTHORIZED_ROLE` environment variable and it
                works regardless if you happen to be using either webhooks or
                JWTs elsewhere.

                ES modules are stateful singletons, but in a different way than
                CJS modules are. I still need to understanding exactly how.

                I've been adding auth to my Next.js/Hasura side project. It's
                the first time I've worked with JWTs and boy are these flows
                complex. Lots of bad / poorly written articles out there, but
                this was one from Hasura was the most helpful so far.

                On the video production side, I learned that{" "}
                <em>color correction</em> is fixing issues with raw footage
                (like adjusting white balance or correcting exposure) while{" "}
                <em>color grading</em> is applying effects for stylistic
                purposes (like adding a cyan tint for a movie-like look).

                This week's podcast was an interesting chat about the "modern
                web," the state of SPA development, and how React is planning on
                moving more work to the server. Loved Rich Harris's take.

                Added CRUD operations to Mirage's REPL. Had fun learning about

                Made some videos on contextual components in Octane. Still my

                Webpack supports a <code>sideEffects: false</code> option you
                can use to tell build tools if your library is tree-shakable. We
                added it to Mirage because even though it does have side
                effects, they shouldn't stop it from being tree-shaken.

                fascinating accomplishment of engineering. Asynchrony ruins
