                Dependabot has been churning through our Netlify build resources
                for miragejs.com. We automerge in-range dependency updates, so
                the Netlify preview builds for Dependabot PRs were literally
                going unused. I learned that you can tell Netlify not to build a
                PR if the commit message has "[skip netlify]" in it, so I
                customized our Dependabot config to add this ‚Äì and it worked!
                Still need to smooth this out a bit as the builds are ignored
                when merged to master, but for now it is helping alleviate the
                problem. Check out the link for our current config.

                Hasura lets you configure permissions for unauthenticated users,
                which is perfect for making certain queries public (like the
                blog posts for your homepage) without needing to add support for
                user accounts. The docs are confusing and also incorrect in a
                few places, but all you need to do is set the
                `HASURA_GRAPHQL_UNAUTHORIZED_ROLE` environment variable and it
                works regardless if you happen to be using either webhooks or
                JWTs elsewhere.

                I finished Part 8 of Mirage's tutorial on Factories. Was hoping
                to get the whole thing done this week, but alas.

                I got Firebase auth working in my Hasura/Next.js app in two
                different ways: JWT and Session Cookies. Planning on making a
                YouTube video about it soon.

                This post from Coda Hale helped me understand some interesting
                things about CAP as I was prepping this week's video.

                In reading about auth I learned a bit about symmetric vs.
                asymmetric encryption. How asymmetric encryption works is really
                fascinating. I have some more learning to do here but might make
                for good future video content.

                ES modules are stateful singletons, but in a different way than
                CJS modules are. I still need to understanding exactly how.

                Webpack supports a <code>sideEffects: false</code> option you
                can use to tell build tools if your library is tree-shakable. We
                added it to Mirage because even though it does have side
                effects, they shouldn't stop it from being tree-shaken.
