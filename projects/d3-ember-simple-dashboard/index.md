Reporting tools like dashboards can be very powerful, and with the rise of Javascript and some excellent data visualization libraries like [D3.js](http://www.d3js.org) their presence is becoming ubiquitous.

I've used several tools to build these types of applications, and so far none have accomplished the task with the simplicity or elegance of Ember.js. This modest 200-line demo is extensible, easily hooks into existing D3 work, and has a fully-functioning router:

You can watch me build this app [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz7Jy2abm10) (here are the [slides](http://slid.es/samselikoff/ember-and-d3)), or take a look at the code for each part:

 - [Part 1 - Scaffolding](/projects/d3-ember-simple-dashboard/part1-scaffolding.html)
 - [Part 2 - Datepicker](/projects/d3-ember-simple-dashboard/part2-datepicker.html)
 - [Part 3 - Data from routes](/projects/d3-ember-simple-dashboard/part3-data-from-routes.html)
 - [Part 4 - Data within routes](/projects/d3-ember-simple-dashboard/part4-data-within-routes.html)
 - [Part 5 - Flexibility](/projects/d3-ember-simple-dashboard/part5-flexibility.html)
