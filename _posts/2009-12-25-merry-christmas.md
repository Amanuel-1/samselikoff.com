Over the past year, I have taken a strong liking to those figures in our world who ardently and intelligently champion freedom; in particular, Milton Friedman, Thomas Sowell, and Friedrich August von Hayek have greatly influenced my way of thinking.

Today I reflect on Jesus Christ, whose birth, death and resurrection have given me ultimate freedom, in this life and the next, and who ultimately makes worthwhile the cause of freedom itself. Indeed, his amazing life has been the basis on which my love of liberty has developed.

Merry Christmas everyone!
