I just listened to some podcasts about company culture at Asana and Facebook. Facebook never takes their success for granted. Their floors are concrete, not nice polished wood. Asana adopted Apple's DRI (directly responsible individual) policy so each project has a single goto person, who is accountable. They discuss milestones and goals every week. Individuals share a roadmap with the whole company, some specific objective they are striving to complete by, say, next Thursday. If they don't, the whole company will know. But it's not to break them down - it's to discuss why the thing didn't happen, why their estimate was off and to get better.

Intex, on the other hand, prides itself in not pushing anybody too hard. People don't really have goals or milestones. There is little communication between employees. Workers get bogged down in the day-to-day, maintaining their systems. And we're redoing our floors - the building will look nice, which tells people that we've made it, relax, come to your job and maintain the status quo and you'll take home a fat paycheck and be happy. No pressure. Take it easy. 

In general, the strive is to maintain the status quo. People are generally happy with their lifestyle and aren't driven to make the product superior. There is little competition, so this understandable. People leave at 6:00 every day. There is no push to get things out the door at a certain time. Contrast this to the DRI, where one person has put themselves out on a limb, told the whole company when they plan on finishing something, and organized their team to help the. The team wants to finish, not for the CEO, but for themselves and for their DRI. Very little thought is given to tactics such as these at Intex.

A woman who works at Facebook said employees behave according to rewards and punishments. So Facebook is deliberate in how their company space is set up and what the incentives for their workers are. Failure is not seen as a bad thing, and succes is rewarded. At Intex, people get paid a ridiculous amount of money, pretty much regardless of how they're doing. You can go a whole day working moderately hard, but taking a lot of coffee breaks or browsing the Internet, or you can focus and work extremely hard and stay late to finish something up. But there's no real incentive to do one or the other.

Ultimately, it feels like everyone is working for themselves. Everyone is happy that they're making a lot of money, and it's a somewhat fun company to work at, in terms of how relaxing it is, the free food, the hours. But nobody wants to really come together and figure out how to move the product forward, how to stop wasting time and how to make the company a refined, polished and well-oiled machine.

I have no desire to work somewhere for the paycheck + to just maintain the status quo. I am interested in realizing the potential of my intellect and skills. Learning is going to be a lifetime thing for me, so I won't spend 8 hours a day in an environment where learning is discouraged in favor of maintenance.
