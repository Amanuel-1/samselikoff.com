Here are my notes from [Rian Van Der Merwe's](https://twitter.com/RianVDM) talk at [UX Burlington 2015](http://uxburlington.com/).

----------------

- Why does it suck?
  1. Lack of empathy. You sell software to someone who wants control, configurability and customization, compliance... But the users just want to *get stuff done*.  
      - As fewer people are able to use it, fewer people want to, until nobody does
      - Need to build for the job *our users wants to accomplish.*
  2. Too much legacy
      - **Waterfalls**. Spirit of agile.
      - Sprints do not mean agile.
          + Silos in an org
          + Too many people need to get involved to ship anything
      - Bureaucracy
- The dysfunction in the organization becomes the dysfunction in the product, and that gets passed onto the customer.

- How to solve this?
  1. Show the business the value of design
      - Market cap of design-driven companies (translate: more $)
      - Cost savings. The cost of making changes is dramatically different during design (1x) development (6x) and after launch (100x) (source: Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Appraoch)
  2. Shrink user-centered design to fit
      - "We don't have time up front." What about the inevitable phase 2?
      - Everything is on a scale, do what you can with the resources you have
      - From more costly to less costly:
        - *Exploration:* Studies, interviews, asking a friend
        - *Prototyping:* HTML, clickable prototype, paper sketch
        - *User testing:* formal, Starbucks
  3. Turn sales into a product design function. Product Forces framework gives us a common language to talk about this (jobstobedone.org)
      - Product forces: push of a situation, pull of the new idea
      - Allegiance to current behavior, anxiety of new situation
  4. Break down silos + encourage collaboration
      - Start with product discovery
      - Run a design studio. Get people together, design indepedently, share simultaneously.
      - Do user research

- Process leads to better Enterprise software
- More about facilitation than design
- Show them why it's important
  + You're not going to make their lives difficult
  + Give them a framework that covers the whole product
  + Make them part of the process
  + **Avoid politics, include people**
