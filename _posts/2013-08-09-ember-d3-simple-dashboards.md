Last night I gave a talk at the [Boston Ember.js](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Ember-js/) meetup group. Here are the materials from my presentation.

**Slides:** [http://slid.es/samselikoff/ember-and-d3](http://slid.es/samselikoff/ember-and-d3)

**Demo:** Each part is self-contained, so you can view source to see exactly what's going on:  

 - [Part 1 - Scaffolding](/projects/d3-ember-simple-dashboard/part1-scaffolding.html)
 - [Part 2 - Datepicker](/projects/d3-ember-simple-dashboard/part2-datepicker.html)
 - [Part 3 - Data from routes](/projects/d3-ember-simple-dashboard/part3-data-from-routes.html)
 - [Part 4 - Data within routes](/projects/d3-ember-simple-dashboard/part4-data-within-routes.html)
