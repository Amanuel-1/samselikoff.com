<aside><strong>UPDATE 9/26/13:</strong> I gave an updated version of this talk in September. There's no video, but you can find the materials <a href="http://www.samselikoff.com/blog/2013/09/26/updated-ember-d3-talk/">here</a>. The big changes are the upgrade to Ember 1.0, and the use of components over views.</aside>

Last night I gave a talk at the [Boston Ember.js](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Ember-js/) meetup group. Here are the materials from my presentation.
