How can we keep UX the focus of a growing organization? We need a set of tools, practices and guidelines. Let's look at five stages.

**Stage 1: Research.** Find your project's stakeholders, and figure out what they want.

  - Instead of simply building desired **outputs**, focus on desired **outcomes**.
  - Above all, listen. And take good notes! One way to do this, use a sharpie on small yellow stickes. This is the level of fidelity you should want during a brainstorming session - forces you to distill a request down to its essence.
  - Then, organize your stickies using this grid:

  
                                 Delight 
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
         Unnecessary---------------------------------------Necessary
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                                  Disgust 

    This will help you prioritize your stakeholders' desired outcomes.

**Stage 2: Requirements.** Get out of the building, and talk to people. Ask open-ended questions. Ask about past experiences. Keep them talking - "Tell me more."

  - You'll find that some of your ideas fall flat. *Talking to users forces you to reassess the assumptions and expectations you have about your product.*

**Stage 3: Design.** Run a design session. Get a group of people. The purpose here is to generate as many ideas as possible. Get all sorts of users, developers, designers, product people. Then
  
  1. Start with 8-ups. Fold an 8.5 x 11 piece of paper in half three times, and ask everyone to sketch what they'd like the app to do. Sandbox to 10 minutes. Very low-fidelity, purpose is to just get ideas.    
    - Then, get feedback on everyone's designs

  2. Do it again, but with 2-ups. Fold the paper in half once. Allow some time for higher fidelity sketches. Get feedback again.

  3. Then, move to wireframing.

**Stage 4: Development.** *Measure* your future goals. Try to get both quantitative and qualitative measures. Create workable prototypes via Keynote.

Ultimately, when scaling UX, the only non-negotiable principle is communication.
