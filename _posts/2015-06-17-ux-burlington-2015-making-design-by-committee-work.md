This talk will explore some lessons learned from a large UI redesign.

## Start with empathy for the user

Product featuritis. The Pontiac Aztec is one of the "worst cars of all time". Design committee used focus groups, but the product fell flat.

Why does Featuritis occur? Product teams often dive in too late in the design process:

Many start at Ideate instead of Empathize.

*Don't let the funder of a product cloud who you're building the product for! Focus on solving your **user's** problems.

## The importance of emotional intelligence

Groups are most create when they trust 

## Mental biases in groups

## Parallel thinking

## Tips to boost your creative team
