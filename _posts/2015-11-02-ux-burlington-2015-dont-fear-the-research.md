Here are my notes from [Eva Kaniasty's](https://twitter.com/kaniasty) talk at [UX Burlington 2015](http://uxburlington.com/).

----------------

- Design is not easy. There's a huge fear of failure.
- Designers see input from users as bad news
- There are three fears:
  + Usability testing. The fear here is, you're ultimately testing the people who did the design.
  + Fear of change
  + Fear of wasting time and money
- Rewards for doing user research:
  + Improved process ("agile"). Linear is easier, but iteration is actually better.
  + Good decisions
  + Fun! (esp when people are involved)
- Henry Ford quote, users didn't know what they wanted
  + Well, we don't ask people what they want either, but we do ask them about their feelings, their frustrations etc.
  + Is it intuitive?
  + Is it compelling?
  + Empathy helps us get there
- Research saves time and money
  + 40% of dev time is spent reworking existing designs
  + Fixing an error after development is up to 100 times as expensive as before
- Case studies
  + Two different companies came to Eva for user research
  + First came through a design agency. The user research had little impact, in large part because the design agency (rather than the actual client) was in control 
  + Second client came directly to Eva, and the research had a big impact
  + Lessons learned:
    * Startups tend to not want external research, but an outside perspective can be very valuable
    * Don't rely on others to be your advocate. You know best about the value you can bring
  + Ultimately, communication and collaboration between design and research is crucial for success
  + Trust is also crucial. Don't just let your reports speak for themselves. Use direct contact to convince the client.
- Overcome fears
  + Connect
  + Collaborate
  + Iterate
