Here are my notes from [Katie McCurdy's](https://twitter.com/katiemccurdy) talk at [UX Burlington 2015](http://uxburlington.com/).

----------------

- Conduct interviews and observe, ideally in users' own environments
- Participatory design. Bring users in early on in the design process. Output is an artifact that you can use during design.
  + For example, asked patients to draw their symptoms on a body. Insight: patients used shapes to indicate sensation on their body (star for sharp pain).
- Usability testing
  + Can be cheap and fast
  + Purpose: to find out if your product is usable
    * For example, used the color red for a health app. Diabetics saw this as guilt-inducing.
- Building trust is key
