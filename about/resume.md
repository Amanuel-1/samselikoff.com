TO DO FROM ALEX
- recruiters are looking at shiny words they don't know about css3, html5, javascript
- recruiters look at years of experience, e.g. JavaScript (1+ yr) etc.
- dates are not consistent, some are just years, some month and year
- you need to put on your resume things that you're great at; so "beginner" can be safely removed
- link to github helps
- link to your talks helps as well
