  <p>The big picture is important to me, and I like being able to contribute to every part of a project. I'm a self-starter with a passion for building beautiful, valuable software. I'm currently focusing on Javascript - specifically data visualization and client-side MVC.</p>

  <p>Before learning web development, I was pursuing a doctoral degree in economics. After realizing that academia wasn't for me, I discovered programming, and haven't looked back since. <a href="{% post_url 2013-05-26-a-new-career %}">Read more about my career change in this blog post.</a></p>

  <p>Besides programming, I enjoy reading, playing guitar, photography, and spending time with friends and family. I currently live in Boston and occasionally get to see my wife Jenna, who's in medical school. We also have a Yorkie named Zoe. She's all attitude.</p>
