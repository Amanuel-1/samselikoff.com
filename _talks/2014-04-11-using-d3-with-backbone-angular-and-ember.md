In this talk, Sam Selikoff will discuss the use of D3 within JavaScript applications built with MVC frameworks, while embracing the frameworks' individual idioms and treating D3 code as first-class.

This talk will discuss specifics of using D3 within the context of three popular frameworks: Backbone, Angular and Ember. Sam will discuss the limits and strengths of Backbone views, how to create D3-based Angular directives and demonstrate building Ember components with D3.

Sam will also discuss reusability of D3-based code across the three frameworks.
