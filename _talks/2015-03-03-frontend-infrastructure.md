Monolithic server-side applications are on the way out - but what does this mean for our frontend code? A world of independent backend services creates unique challenges for internal frontend development: How can teams share code? Streamline deployments? Test and integrate their code with existing backend systems?

This talk will discuss how Ember's conventions and tooling can bring consistency, discipline and sanity to a company's frontend infrastructure.
